# 🧠 AI Debate Simulator

An interactive app where **two AI models debate** on any topic, streamed in real-time, and a **third model judges** their arguments based on clarity, logic, evidence, rebuttal quality, and civility.

Built with:
- ⚡ **FastAPI** backend for asynchronous debate orchestration  
- 🧩 **Streamlit** frontend for live debate visualization  
- 🤖 **OpenRouter API** for multi-model LLM access  

---

## ✨ Features

- **Automatic Debates** — Two models argue for and against a given topic.
- **Live Streaming** — Each turn streams word-by-word in real time.
- **Configurable Personalities & Temperatures** — Shape model behavior and creativity.
- **Multi-Round Debates** — Choose the number of exchanges.
- **AI Judge** — A third model evaluates and announces the winner.
- **Optional API Key** — Supports both free and paid OpenRouter models.
- **Persistent State** — Keeps debate progress visible during runtime.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ai-debate-simulator.git
cd ai-debate-simulator
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
The app uses **Python 3.10+**.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don’t have a `requirements.txt` yet, you can create one with:
```txt
fastapi
uvicorn
aiohttp
requests
streamlit
pydantic
orjson
```

---

### 3️⃣ Start the project
```bash
./run.sh
```

This launches the FastAPI backend and the frontend

## 🔑 OpenRouter API Key

To use paid or advanced models, get your key from [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai) and paste it into the sidebar.  
If no key is provided, only free models will appear.

---

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **Choose Models & Settings**
   - Select a topic, number of rounds, personas, and LLMs for each role.
2. **Start the Debate**
   - Models take turns streaming their arguments (`pro` vs `con`).
3. **Judgment Phase**
   - After all rounds, the `judge` model scores and declares a winner.

## 🧠 Example Debate Flow

| Role | Description |
|------|--------------|
| 🟢 **PRO** | Argues *for* the topic (structured reasoning, evidence-based). |
| 🔴 **CON** | Argues *against* the topic (critical, analytical, skeptical). |
| ⚖️ **JUDGE** | Evaluates based on clarity, logic, evidence, rebuttal, and civility. |

| Rounds | Number of back-and-forth exchanges |
| Persona | Behavior style for each debater |
| Model | LLM chosen from OpenRouter |
| Temperature | Controls creativity/variance |
| API Key | Optional key for paid models |

## 🧪 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/health` | Check server status |
| `POST` | `/debate/start` | Start a new debate session |
| `POST` | `/debate/step_stream` | Stream the next turn (NDJSON) |
| `POST` | `/debate/judge` | Generate final judgment |
